# Audio Processing and Command Recognition

The project involves several components:

Loading an audio file and resampling it to a desired sample rate.
Simulating real-time streaming of audio data.
Processing the audio data in real-time to detect and recognize words.
Labeling the detected words and saving the results to a file.

The audio frames are processed in real-time to detect and recognize words.
The detected words are labeled and stored in the results array.
If the word "galactic" is recognized, the corresponding frames are labeled as 1; otherwise, they are labeled as 0.
