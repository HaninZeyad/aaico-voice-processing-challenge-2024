# AAICO February 2024 Voice Processing Challenge

## Welcome

Welcome to the AAICO January 2024 Voice Processing Challenge! This repository contains the necessary resources and information to participate in the challenge. Please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful participation.

### Challenge Overview

The challenge involves completing the '**aaico_voice_processing_challenge.py**' file. This file simulates the streaming of the '**audio_aaico_challenge.wav**' audio file. Frame by frame, the "emit_data" thread emits the data of the audio file. Each frame consists of 512 samples, with a sample rate of 16000 Hz for the audio file.

The "process_data" thread receives these frames. Your task is to complete the code in this thread to label each received sample and save your label using the provided function "label_samples". A sample should be labeled 0 if it is detected as a command, otherwise 1 (we consider that everything that is not a command should be broadcast).

Once the code is executed, a '**results.pkl**' file will be saved, which is an array containing for each sample:

- The time at which the sample was emitted.
- The label you assigned to the sample.
- The time at which the sample was labelled.

More details on the challenge are provided here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nacv8gT2kfG2wGWXIdKaisStBy2xfGPJIGy27AqqEo4.

You can evaluate your results directly on Colab in which the scoring method is fully explicit: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ekMF1UFfr3djseliJleUNpvzfyIJP57G?usp=sharing by uploading the results.pkl file (along with the audio_aaico_challenge.wav file).

### Instructions

To submit your solution, fork the repository, create a branch with the name of your team, push to your branch and then create a pull request to the original repository. Indicate in the Solution description section (below) your team's name, the name and email of each member and a description of your solution.

To have your solution considered, it must be reproducible by the AAICO team.

### Solution description (to complete)
The process_data function processes the data frames by first clipping the audio data to the valid range of 0 to 255, then converting it to characters using the chr() function. The characters are concatenated to a string called current_word until a complete word is detected. When a complete word is detected, the process_current_word function is called to process the word and label the corresponding frames in the results array.

The process_current_word function takes the completed word and the index of the first frame in the word as input arguments. It checks if the word is "galactic" or not, and labels the corresponding frames in the results array with 1 or 0, respectively.
